# Best Value for Car

In this project, I have tried to build an AI model using Python to predict the actual value of cars listed in a dataset provided by CarDekho, which has information on a wide variety of cars, including their price. This model will help you figure out how much exactly you should pay for your car by taking into account various factors like the car's Transmission, Age, Fuel Type, Seller Type, etc.

To make the predictions, I have utilized a linear regression model. Linear Regression is a method for discovering the relationship between two variables in the dataset, such as the price of the car and the year it was made. I have also used many other Python libraries including matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data.

You can run this project on Google Colab without manually downloading any of the python libraries used.
